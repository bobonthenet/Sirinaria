# Keeyar and Noeyar - Gatekeepers of the Underworld

The Gatekeepers of the underworld are the twin deities Keeyar and Noeyar before the first Dawn when the gods were assigned their roles Keeyar and Noeyar were envied by all the other gods for their strong bond to one another, their beauty and quick wit. The twins were inseparable before the first dawn believed at one time to be one divine soul within with two faces it was thought to be the will of the divine source, but the envy of the other gods served to divide them until the world's final dusk. When the gods cast their ballots to sign the exalted tasks that the twins would be required to carry out until the end of days they were made shepherds of the underworld but their domains separated by land and sea so that they would never meet again it is said that if a soul is a servant of one and has news of the other they will receive favor from the other.
