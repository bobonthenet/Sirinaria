# House Rules
The Sirinaria Campaign Setting is best played using [Old School Essentials by Necrotic Gnome](https://necroticgnome.com/collections/old-school-essentials) along with the house rules described on this website. While I highly recommend actually purchasing the physical books, you can also use the PDFs or even the free [system reference documents](https://oldschoolessentials.necroticgnome.com/srd/index.php/Main_Page).

I don't have any house rules ready to publish yet so keep checking back.
