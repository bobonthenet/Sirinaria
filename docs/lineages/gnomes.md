# Gnomes
Gnomes, those delightful denizens of Sirinaria, are renowned for their boundless friendliness and unwavering generosity. Within their diminutive frames, they possess a wisdom that belies their size, yet they are perpetually perplexed and slightly affronted by the reluctance of larger folk to accept their warm invitations into their cozy abodes.

As a relatively recent addition to the diverse tapestry of Sirinaria, gnomes share a kinship with their sturdy cousins, the dwarves, while also bearing the faint trace of fey ancestry. Blending the dwarven love for craftsmanship with the fey's penchant for revelry and trickery, gnomes embody a unique fusion of industriousness, freedom, and mischievous mirth.

The Rock gnomes, nestled in the northern fringes of the Dwarven Citadel, find solace between the mighty mountains and the sprawling forests to the north. In their camps, a scene evoking a fantastical blend of eclectic wonders and ingenious resourcefulness, they ingeniously repurpose forgotten or discarded treasures, along with any odds and ends that catch their inquisitive eyes. No two items in a gnome camp are ever the same, their creations diverse and distinct. Occasionally, the discerning dwarves may even procure these curious contrivances as artwork or conversation pieces. Hence, the Rock gnomes have earned the affectionate moniker of "the recyclers" among their kin.

Further north, amidst the embrace of ancient woodlands, reside the Forest gnomes. Closer in spirit to their fey lineage, they proudly don the traditional gnome caps, a charming symbol of their connection to the natural world. Ever mindful of their neighbors, gnomes predominantly keep to themselves, striving to avoid any unnecessary conflicts. As a result, many dwarves, humans, and elves may have only heard whispers of these enchanting beings, their sightings a rare and treasured experience.

In the vibrant tapestry of Sirinaria, gnomes occupy a cherished niche, exuding warmth, creativity, and a touch of whimsy. Their tiny footsteps leave a lasting impression on the hearts of those fortunate enough to cross paths with these industrious tricksters. Whether crafting wondrous contraptions or weaving tales of merriment, gnomes remind all who encounter them that life is meant to be lived with joy, ingenuity, and an unyielding spirit of camaraderie.
