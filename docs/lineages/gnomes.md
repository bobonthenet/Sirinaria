# Gnomes
Gnomes are among the most friendly and generous of the fairy to humans. While they seem wise in many respects they are however, continually bewildered and offended that big folk never seem to want to accept an invitation into their diminutive homes. Gnomes are a relatively minor race new to the world of Sirinaria, cousins to the Dwarves, but with some fey ancestry as well.  They inherited the dwarven love of working on things, and the fey love of life, freedom, and tricks.  The Rock gnomes live on the northern outskirts of the Dwarven Citadel, between the mountains and the forests to the north, in camps reminiscent of Mad Max.  They use forgotten or discarded things from the Dwarves (along with anything else they can find) to build their homes and to tinker various things into existence - you will not find 2 identical items anywhere in a gnome camp.  Sometimes the Dwarves will buy things, possibly as art or conversation pieces.  A frequent nickname for the rock gnomes is "the recyclers". Forest gnomes live farther north, in the woods, and are a bit closer to their fey ancestry and are more likely to be seen wearing the traditional gnome cap. The gnomes mostly keep to themselves, trying not to antagonize any of their neighbors. Thus, many Dwarves, Humans, and Elves are likely to have never seen a gnome, but a lot have heard of them.
