# Humans

Humans, the delicate pawns of conflict, embodied the paradox of existence in Sirinaria. With their ephemeral lifespans and deeply ingrained tribal inclinations, they possessed the quintessential traits for manipulation and readiness for battle. Both the ancient dragons, primordial beings of awe-inspiring might, and the Eldritch horrors from the tumultuous realms beyond the dimensional borders of Sirinaria, employed humans as tools, reshaping and molding them to serve their respective agendas in the cataclysmic war. The enigmatic outsiders twisted the hapless humans into savage orcs, while the majestic dragons endowed them with draconic heritage, birthing the resolute dragonborn. Yet, it was in the aftermath of this epic conflict that the whimsical fairies, ever the creators of wonders, fashioned the graceful elven race as a whimsical diversion, extracting the essence of humanity for their amusement.

In the tapestry of sentient races, humans emerged as the embodiment of adaptability and versatility. Their resilience shone bright in the wake of the great war, as they became the architects of vast and magnificent empires, their indomitable spirit driving them to conquer new frontiers. Yet, it was also humanity's restless ambition and unchecked passions that ultimately brought about the downfall of those very empires, an eternal testament to their paradoxical nature.
