# Dwarves

Dwarves can be found all over Sirinaria but most live within the massive Dwarven city of Citadel. Dwarves are long lived with an age of 450 years not altogether uncommon. Typically they live closer to 350 though, due in no small part to unhealthy lifestyle choices.

Dwarven culture opposes outright slavery but they do have a practice of indentured servitude. Less scrupulous dwarves will make it very difficult for debters to be freed from their servitude by making the debts very difficult to pay off and simultaniously increasing the debt. While outright slavery is illegal, the line can become very blurred when it comes to this practice.

Before the first dawn Thunir created the Dwarven race in secret deep below the ground for this Thunir was exiled from the heavens and lives among his people as God and King of the dwarves. All dwarves worship Thunir the great strength of the small statured dwarves is attributed to their closeness with their God.

dwarves are assigned to their jobs during childhood, Thunir assigns their role on their fifth birthday along with a blessing that appears as the first hint of facial stubble.

The Dwarven city is massive, far larger than even the largest three human cities put together. The city spans deep into the Earth and also includes the Citadel, a single Tower large enough to house thousands of dwarves, their homes, businesses and even Parks farms and other common City locations.

It is a very commonly held belief that the dwarves biggest export is minerals from within the Earth. However this is very untrue in fact the dwarves largest export is their produce. This consists of a dwarven carrot, the cave bean, and mountain loaf (euphemism for ground up cave crickets pressed into a loaf), in addition to a massive variety of mushroom. The largest dwarven import is lumber.
