# Elves
Elves in Sirinaria are the descendants of humans that have spent too much time in the fay realm. They look human but also have an otherworldly appearance about them that causes them to appear somehow not human. This appearance is different depending on where they are from and seems to be an influence of their environment. Most elves see both fairies and humans as their brethren but often more closely identify with the fairy.
