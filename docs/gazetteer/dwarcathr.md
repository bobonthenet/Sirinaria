# Dwar'Cathr
The Dwarven city is massive, far larger than even the largest three human cities put together. The city spans deep into the Earth and also includes the Citadel, a single Tower large enough to house thousands of dwarves, their homes, businesses and even Parks farms and other common City locations.
