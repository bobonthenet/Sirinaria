# Hastdurn

[![Hastdurn](/hastdurn.png "Click to see larger map")](/hastdurn.png)
The island that is the focal point right now is called Hastdurn. It is a larger forested island with mountains on the western shores, forests covering most of the north and flat planes to the south east. The large city of [Greegate](./greegate.md) sits in the middle where two rivers meet, then continue to flow south. [Greegate](./greegate.md) is a mostly human city, ruled by a vampire named Arito Greegate. The fact that Greegate is a vampire is one of those well known secrets among the citizens and isn't often talked about in the open. Also in the West tucked against the foothills of the mountains is the massive Dwarven city known as [Dwar'Cathr](./dwarcathr.md). [Dwar'Cathr](./dwarcathr.md) is a huge arcology that extends deep into the earth as well as tower into the clouds. Millions of [dwarves](../lineages/dwarves.md) live their entire lives within this massive structure, yet never actually see it in it's entirety simply because of how large it is. [Dwarves](../lineages/dwarves.md) also have the distinct privilege of having their god [Thunir](../pantheon/thunir.md) live among them in the top of the structure. The [Fellnari](./fellnariforest.md) are the woods that cover most of Hastdurn. These woods are filled with all sorts of creatures, from monsters, to minor gods, and ruled by a powerful arch fay named Nimrinde.
