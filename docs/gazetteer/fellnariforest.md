# Fellnari Forest

The Fellnari Forest makes up most of the Northern end of Hastdurn. These forests are filled with goblins grouped together mostly in small bands, as well as all manner of other dangerous creatures. The woods are also rich with valuable resources from the wood of the trees, herbs, wild game and just about any magical reagent a wizard or alchemist could want if they know where to look.

Logging is common along the rivers of the Fellnari. Cut down trees quickly replenish themselves either by magic or simply the rich soil that the forest grows upon or maybe it is a combination of the two. Felled trees are pushed into the river where they then travel directly to [Greegate](greegate) to be used for construction in the city or shipped to one of the other major cities in Sirinaria. The village of [Hawksmont](hawksmont) is a growing logging town located at the edge of the forest.

The Fellnari is also one of the locations where the veil between this world and that of the fae is especially thin. Travelers through the forest need to be wary. The fae are not inherently evil but are creatures of chaos and do not hold to the same standard of what constitutes as good that the average Sirinarian would adhere to.
