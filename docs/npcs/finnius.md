# Finnius the Shopkeep

Finnius, the refined goblin shopkeeper, is a peculiar sight. Despite his diminutive stature, he exudes an air of sophistication, adorned in a finely tailored suit with a waistcoat of vibrant colors. His sharp wit matches his impeccable style, as he converses with customers in a manner that surprises even the most eloquent of speakers.

Within his quaint shop, nestled within a hidden pocket dimension, an enchanting array of exotic spices tantalize the senses. Fragrant jars line the shelves, each containing a story from a distant land. Alongside the spices, shelves also hold a carefully curated collection of potions, their mystical essence swirling within delicate vials. Among the shelves, one may discover trinkets and curiosities that catch the eye of adventurers seeking the extraordinary.

To find Finnius's elusive emporium, one must seek out the enigmatic portals that manifest as inconspicuous openings in the earth, trees, or rocks. Marked by a weathered wooden sign bearing the inscription "Adventurer's Shoppe," these portals beckon the curious and the daring to step into a world where flavors, scents, and arcane wonders converge.
