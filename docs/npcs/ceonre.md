# Ceonre the Ranger

The bad luck of Ceonre the ranger while gambling is almost legendary. It is believed that he started gambling at a young age and was cursed by his own mother before he left for the forests to become a ranger. Ceonre is a frequent visitor to the village of [Hawksmont](../gazetteer/hawksmont.md) which is nested in the woods where he lives. He will come into town and sell valuables obtained from deep in the forest including his prized hand-rolled cigarettes. Once everything has been sold he will settle into Browold’s Tavern, drink and gamble until he has lost every penny he’s made. Once he is evicted from the tavern he’ll return to the forest until he is able to replenish his supplies. Ceonre has never been seen in the forest and no one knows where he makes his home but he has a vast knowledge of the surrounding area which can often be very valuable to the people that live in the surrounding villages. Most valuable of this knowledge is the movement of the hundreds of goblin gangs and tribes that infest the forests.
