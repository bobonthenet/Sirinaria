# Pip Sprocketwings

Pip is military veteran of some renown. She is still well liked by the other fairy citizens of Llyndairwen, even though these days she is pretty much just a thief. Pip has a great appreciation for anyone that will listen to her war stories against the trolls.

Her loyal corgi mount is named Wisp.
