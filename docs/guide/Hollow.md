# Hollow

Hollow is a small gold mining town. It was on the verge of becoming a prosperous boom town when the mine owner shut everything down and has since become a rat infested, delapitated, shell of its former self, virtually a ghost town. A majority of the homes, and businesses are shuttered and in ruins, but a few still remain.

## The Pork Pie Tavern
The Pork Pie Tavern serves as city hall, community center, and of course the only drinking establishment for Hollow's dwindling population.

## General Store
This establishment was a centerpoint when Hollow was on the rise. Now it carries only the essentials with most of its shelves empty.

## The Butcher Shoppe
The owner of this establishment had a successful business in Greegate but moved to Hollow for the promise of more wealth in what was a rapidly growing mining boom town. Now he struggles with debt, wanting to leave but too poor to do so.
