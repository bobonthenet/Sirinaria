# Ceonre

Ceonre wears all black except for his boots which are brown or perhaps would be black if they werenâ€™t caked in mud. His hair hangs down the back of his cloak in a long tangled mass of dreads, he has a long nose and brown eyes. He also has a pet hawk. Ceonre is almost never seen without one of his strong smelling signature hand-rolled long cigarettes. He is a warden of the Ch'thul Woodlands. He is known amongst the villagers of Hawksmont as Hard Luck Coenre, since misfortune seems to follow wherever he goes. He is also rumoured to be married to the fairy queen Nimrinde. She even claims to be carrying his child. Ceonre is both in love with and terrified of Nimrinde and will immediatly flee if he is aware of her presence nearby. Nimrinde has absolute mastery over every tree, stone and creature within her domain, but somehow despite his famed hard luck, Ceonre seems to be immune to her control.
