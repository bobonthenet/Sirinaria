1.  What is the deal with my cleric's religion? The main Religion in Hawksmont is the worship of Mutar. One of Mutar's core tenants is the paying of one's debts. Mutar is a god of balance.
    
2.  Where can we go to buy standard equipment? There is a general store, operated by a government official from Greegate. It is sort of a company store. All the logs are sent to Ingbluff but Hawksmont itself is actually a part of Greegate.
    
3.  Where can we go to get platemail custom fitted for this monster I just befriended? Something like this would have to be done in Greegate. Hawksmont would not have such facilities
    
4.  Who is the mightiest wizard in the land? Nearest to Hawksmont that would be either Angela who lives in the Silfas woodlands, this is part of the same forest as Ch'thul but on the other side of the main river that flows between them. It is not too uncommon for the witch Angela to be found in Browold Tavern when she isn't feeling welcome in Hollow. Or there is a wizard known as the storm mage, that frequents this area. This wizard flies about on the back of a turtle, dodging the lightning within the clouds of a storm. He is notoriously hard of hearing. Probably because of his constant proximity to thunder.
    
5.  Who is the greatest warrior in the land? This would be Coenre the warden of the Ch'thul woodlands.
    
6.  Who is the richest person in the land? Lord Bannerald of Hollow.
    
7.  Where can we go to get some magical healing? Father Atel Gatlon will do it, for a price. Nothing from the Church of Mutar is free, but the church will also gladly extend credit.
    
8.  Where can we go to get cures for the following conditions: poison, disease, curse, level drain, lycanthropy, polymorph, alignment change, death, undeath? This can also be received from Father Gatlon.
    
9.  Is there a magic guild my MU belongs to or that I can join in order to get more spells? The nearest would be Greegate.
    
10.  Where can I find an alchemist, sage or other expert NPC? The nearest would be Greegate, although it is rumoured that one of the older villagers in Hawksmont has dabbled in some necromancy in the past.
    
11.  Where can I hire mercenaries? Any number of the Woodsman of Hawksmont could make good mercenaries. For professionals the city of Greegate would be the place to go.
    
12.  Is there any place on the map where swords are illegal, magic is outlawed or any other notable hassles from Johnny Law?
    
13.  Which way to the nearest tavern?
    
14.  What monsters are terrorizing the countryside sufficiently that if I kill them I will become famous?
    
15.  Are there any wars brewing I could go fight?
    
16.  How about gladiatorial arenas complete with hard-won glory and fabulous cash prizes?
