# Fundamentals of Religion

Sirinaria has many gods. In fact it is a world filthy with them. They run the gambit from major gods with the ability to shape the very landscape of the entire world, to minor spirits with domains that only have influence over a single small pile of rocks or a puddle of water. That isn't to say that everything in Sirinaria has a god or spirit attached to it, but one can never be too cautious, as a god may become offended if they are ignored, even if an adventurer doesn't even know they exist.

It is the purview of a cleric to recognize and pay head to the many gods that exist throughout Sirinaria. They may have their patron deity that they pay most of their attention and provide worship to, but all clerics know that no spirit or god can simply be ignored.

## Domains

A god's or deific spirit's domain generally has to do with the area that it occupies. Most homes contain spirits that if given the proper respect can provide all sorts of benefits to the residents of that home such as keeping the home warmer than the available firewood on hand would normally be able to, or providing some protection from those with evil intent. A lake spirit if appeased could make fishing in that lake much easier. A major god can grant a cleric the ability to create powerful miracles such as healing wounds and illness or even resurrecting fallen comrads. While most deific spirits powers seem to have strength in proportion to their domain, there are myriad exceptions. For example the hermit cleric Creig has as his patron deity the spirit of a vernal pond, a deity that fades in and out of existence with the seasons, has no other worshippers, and has never been known to create any boon to others, has granted Creig the ability of self resurrection. No other cleric has been known to be able to raise themselves from the dead, yet it has been well documented that Creig has been raised from the dead at least 5 times. Another notable exception to the normal power and ability of the deific spirits is the god Promfus the spirit of an active volcano of the same name. This deity has many worshippers and his domain is a massive and destructive volcano, his followers however have never been known to be granted any special ability.
