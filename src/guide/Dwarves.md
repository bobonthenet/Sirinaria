# Dwarves

Dwarves can be found all over Sirinaria but most live within the massive Dwarven city of Dwarfholm. Dwarves are long lived with an age of 450 years not altogether uncommon. Typically they live closer to 350 though, due in no small part to unhealthy lifestyle choices.

Dwarven culture opposes outright slavery but they do have a practice of indentured servitude. Less scrupulous dwarves will make it very difficult for debters to be freed from their servitude by making the debts very difficult to pay off and simultaniously increasing the debt. While outright slavery is illegal, the line can become very blurred when it comes to this practice.

## Dwarfholm
Both the largest city and artificial structure in all of Sirinaria, Dwarfholm is the birthplace, home and mecca of all dwarf kind.

## Dwarven Religion
Dwarves worship their king.
