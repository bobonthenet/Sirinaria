# Nimrinde

Nimrinde is a being of exceptional beauty. The sight of her by a human causes an enchantment, enthralling the viewer, who feels a deep love and willingness to do anything this child of the fay wills.

Nimrinde appears mostly human, and has a dark complexion with sun-bronzed shoulders. Her long black hair covers her entire back. Her eyes are gold with cat like irises that betray her fae nature. She wears very little. A short grass skirt, some fae jewelry made from precious possibly enchanted stones, and a crown made from antlers and gemstones. Each of these seems to further enhance her appearance. The enchanted won't notice this unless she points it out but she is also pregnant with a child she claims is from a human warden named Ceonre. While the pregnancy shows upon her it does not seem to detract from her beauty in the slightest.
