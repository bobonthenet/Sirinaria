# Introduction

Sirinaria is my campaign setting for Dungeons and Dragons. It is best enjoyed using the brilliant [Old School Essentials by Necrotic Gnome](https://necroticgnome.com/collections/rules). This site contains homebrew rules,  stories, session logs, and everything a player would want to know about the world that their characters live in. It will be updated as gaming sessions reveal new information about the world or things change as a result of actions taken by the characters.
