# Death and Dismemberment

## The Rule

If a character receives damage that would take that character's HP to zero or below, that character becomes unconcious, and then the player should immediately roll a d20 and reference the following table.

| d20   | Effect                                                                                                                                        |
| ----- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1-4   | A scar, the character remains concious but is knocked down. The character on their turn may call for help but must remain prone until healed. |
| 5-6   | Same as above but save to stay concious. If knocked unconcious, the character may not participate in combat in any way.                       |
| 7     | Bleeding. Roll one HD: you will lose it in that many turns. Keep doing this until bandaged or healed or out of HD. If you lose all of your HD the PC is dead.                            |
| 8-9   | You lose something. Disadvantage on some tasks.<br/>Roll d6: 1. Fingers (d4); 2. Hand; 3. Nose; 4. Ear; 5. Eye; 6. Looks.                     |
| 10    | Leg useless. Save to keep it when healed. Disadvantage on agility tasks.                                                                      |
| 11    | Arm useless. Save to keep it when healed. Disadvantage when needing both arms or if it was the dominant hand.                                 |
| 12-13 | Head wound. Disadvantage on all rolls. Save or lose one prepared spell.                                                                       |
| 14    | Dead man walking. You have a number of turns equal to 1 + CON modifier to live.                                                               |
| 15+   | Vital organ destroyed. Instant death.                                                                                                         |

Once the result from this table is determined, the player then has the option to use a pool of dice determined by their hit dice available to roll and obtain a new number that will then be subtracted from the d20 roll and obtain a new result on the above table.

## Example

Exemplarion the level 2 cleric, played by Derek has just taken 4 damage from an ogre barbarian reducing his hit points to zero. Derek then rolls a d20 and sees a 15 on the dice. Oh no! It looks like this may be it for his favorite character Exemplarion! However, the dice gods may yet save the brave cleric. Exemplarion being a level 2 cleric has 2d6 HD. Derek can roll 1 or both of his hit dice to modify his d20 result. Hoping for the best he decides to roll 2d6 and obtains a total result of 6! This reduces his death and dismemberment result to 9. Exemplarion is saved, but not without penalty! Derek rolls an aditional d6 and gets a 3. Exemplarion has lost his nose in this fight, but will live to see another day.

## Oh no my arm's gone!

If a character loses a limb or other body part in battle this should be of little concern. After all consider the alternative! Look at this as an opportunity for additional role play. Also, this character lives in a fantasy world with magic, monsters, and all manner of the supernatural. Any wizard of notable skill is likely to be able to grow you a new one, although it might not behave the same as the original. Remember that stone golem the party felled last week, I bet the arm on that thing is still good. Perhaps it is time to go troll hunting, lob the arm off of one of those, with a little bit of magic healing salve you could have it as your own. Just don't expose it to direct sunlight. Your character might end up even better than before.
