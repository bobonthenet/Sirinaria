Hollow is a small gold mining town. It was on the verge of becoming a prosperous boom town when the mine owner shut everything down and has since become a rat infested, delapitated, shell of its former self, virtually a ghost town. A majority of the homes, and businesses are shuttered and in ruins, but a few still remain.

### Homes
Most business has left the city but a lot of homes still remain. Players may choose to stay in one of the vacant homes rather than the local inn if they choose but the conditions will be very poor unless some effort is put forth for upkeep.

### The Pork Pie Tavern

The Pork Pie Tavern serves as city hall, community center, and of course the only drinking establishment for Hollow's dwindling population. The Pork Pie Tavern is also famous for its pork pies and the fact that it is haunted by its original owner Wilber McWiggins. A contest still in place today says that if anyone can eat an entire mega pie alone within one hour they will receive free food and drink for a month. The former owner of the tavern received criticism of his contest by patrons who had attempted the contest and said it was impossible for anyone to eat a pie that size. McWiggins refuted this criticism by stating it was not impossible and he knew this because he could finish the pie with time to spare and had done so on multiple occasions. He then made a fresh pork mega pie, ate the entire thing within 43 minutes and dropped dead. Now his ghost will appear and taunt patrons if they speak about or attempt the contest and will not leave until someone wins. Many have tried, no one has come close.

### Pogrus General Store

### The Butcher Shoppe

The owner of this establishment had a successful business in Greegate but moved to Hollow for the promise of more wealth in what was a rapidly growing mining boom town. Now he struggles with debt, wanting to leave but too poor to do so.

### Bannerbald Manor

## Notable People

### Regal Bannerbald
Regal is notoriously reclusive. Very little is known about him.

### Selina McWiggins
Selina is the grand niece of Wilber McWiggins and current owner/operator of The Pork Pie Tavern.

### Bolero the Bard
Bolero frequents The Pork Pie Tavern performing and sharing news about the town and surrounding area. It is unclear why a man of his caliber of talent chooses to stay within this dying city when he would likely do very well in one of the more major cities of Sirinaria.
