This place is owned by Pogrus Token. Pogrus has a local boy handle stocking his store, and keep his pipe full. Pogrus himself basically just sits at the front counter asleep a majority of the time. On multiple occasions people have walked in the store and thought he was dead, with the smell and him not moving. A sudden snore though reveals that he isn't. Rather than keep a traditional cash lockbox he has a big decorative clay bowl that customers put the cash in, and even make their own change. Pogrus's store contains all sorts of things one might need in the home or while exploring a dungeon.

Pogrus's inventory has been sparce lately, but he does usually have the bare essential mundane items that a dungeoneering adventurer would need.

Pogrus owns a magical eye that he keeps on a shelf above the counter. It will alert him of any illicit behavior happening within his store and wake him if necessary.
