The Sirinaria Campaign Setting is best played using [Old School Essentials by Necrotic Gnome](https://necroticgnome.com/collections/old-school-essentials) along with the house rules described on this website. While I highly recommend actually purchasing the physical books, you can, however, also use the PDFs or even the free [system reference documents](https://oldschoolessentials.necroticgnome.com/srd/index.php/Main_Page).

*  You must join the [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/pRtR54YwjW).
*  Ignore the rules on alignment languages.
*  If you wish to play a class other than the core classes, such as those from 3rd party source material please discuss with me first. I’ll eventually write more detailed rulings on this, but other classes are probably ok I just want you to ask first.
*  Backstories should be no more than 3 sentences and your character comes from humble beginnings. Character’s choose the adventuring life out of desperation, because life has been unkind and they feel adventuring is the only option. Life is harsh in a medieval world that also has monsters and magic.
*  Magic users can transcribe spell scrolls into their spell books but doing so destroys the scroll, they also must have all the components, purchase inks, paper etc the cost is 1/3 what it would cost to research a magic spell of the same level without a scroll. *  You can also still learn new spells as described in the rules via mentoring or research.
* Acceptions to any of these house rules or the printed OSE rules may be allowed if a good reason is given.
