My Sirinaria campaign setting is currently undergoing a major reboot. I am in the process of gathering a bunch of my writings that I had previously used for different campaign settings, and other fantasy creative works, to incorporate them into a single setting and also rewriting some of the existing content I wasn't really happy with. I also wanted to make room for some content created by others that I especially enjoy and wish to share.

I think the new Sirinaria setting will be a great deal of fun to play and tell stories in. I hope that you will agree.

As of writing this I'm still in the process of gathering everything together. I want to make sure that when it is included here it all feels like it belongs. To that end I need to do a bit more than just copy and paste the text. Some names, locations, dates and soforth will need to change.
